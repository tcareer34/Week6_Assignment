Partner Assignment for Week 6 CNE 310

This Python code defines a function called score_to_letter_grade that converts a numeric grade into a letter grade based on a set of conditions. 
This is a breakdown of what it does:

The function takes a numeric grade as input.
It then checks the value of grade against several thresholds using if-elif conditions to assign the appropriate letter grade:

If grade is 90 or higher, it returns "A".
If grade is between 87 and 89, it returns "B+".
If grade is between 80 and 86, it returns "B".
If grade is between 77 and 79, it returns "C+".
If grade is between 70 and 76, it returns "C".
If grade is between 67 and 69, it returns "D+".
If grade is between 60 and 66, it returns "D".
Otherwise, it returns "F" for any grade below 60.

What is your grade?
